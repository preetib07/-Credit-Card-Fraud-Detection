# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Objective
Build an efficient classification model to detect fraudulent transactions with minimal false positives and high accuracy.

## Project Steps
1. Handle missing values (if any).
2. Engineer meaningful features: transaction frequency, spending patterns, location mismatch.
3. Handle class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Oversampling).
4. Train models and evaluate performance.
5. Use metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries:
